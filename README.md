## Using the StreamReader
* To read Text files and other types of data
* using - to Ensure that the file Will be closed after the use

## Using the StreamWriter
* To write and record text files
* Create JSON files or Text Reports

## Console Top Right Cursos
* I would like to make an option for exit in the top right corner to show in the console. For instance, "type esc to exit."
* So I used Console.WindowWidth
* Also Console.SetCursorPosition
